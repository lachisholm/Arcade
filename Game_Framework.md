# Overview

I am working on learning how to put game framework in place with the Arcade/Python concepts.
This will help me create a simple game to solidify my learning, and help me with building out a basic platformer. This will involve implementing core mechanics like character movement, jumping, and collision detection. Also core concepts like the game loop and user input, ensuring players have control over the action. This will help me to learn to create games to solidify my learning. Then once I finish I will be able to push my skills and allow myself to creat more intricate and engaging game experiences. This could involve intricate level design, challenging obstacles, and maybe even implementing power ups to enahnce the game experience.

## Description of Software

This project is a simple 2D platformer game built using the Python Arcade library. The game features a character that can move left, right, and jump across platforms. This project was developed to demonstrate proficiency in using game frameworks within Python.

### Features

- **Character Movement**: The player can move left, right, and jump using the arrow keys.
- **Simple Physics**: Includes basic gravity and jumping mechanics.
- **Level Design**: A single static level with platforms laid out horizontally.
- **Coins to jump**: A coin is placed in locatins to collect or jump over.

## Creation Purpose

My main purpose here is twofold. First and foremost, I want to establish a strong foundation in the core mechanics that bring games to life. This involves mastering the game loop, the engine that keeps everything running seamlessly, and user input, which ensures palyers have full control over the action. Solidifying these fundamentals, I'll be well equipped to not only understand how games function but also translate those concepts into creating my own interactive experiences.  
The second purpose is to step into the exciting world of game development itself. Once I've grasped the core concepts, I can use this framwork to build a fun and engaging game. This could be anything from a classic side scroller to a fast paced space shooter. The possibilites are wide open for me to enhance the gameplay by adding intricate level design, challenging obstacles and other things my creativity can bring to life.
